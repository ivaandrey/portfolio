## Education  ##
### - Master of Science (M.Sc.) in Computer Vision & Image Processing ###
<img src="images/tel_aviv_university_logo_border.jpg?raw=true" width="5%" height="5%"/>

**[Tel Aviv University](https://www.linkedin.com/school/tel-aviv-university/) : 2012**

My M.Sc. research focused on **Object Tracking with Online Adaptive AdaBoost Classifiers**

[*Tracking with Online Adaptive Classifiers*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7SY7zlmDr0M) is a machine learning-based object tracking approach that **dynamically adapts over time** using AdaBoost classifiers. It is particularly effective for tracking objects in real-time video streams, even when appearance changes due to lighting variations, occlusions, and motion blur.

The core of my approach involves the online selection of the most discriminative **Haar-like features**, which enables the tracker to effectively separate the target from the surrounding background. This method formulates tracking as a classification problem, leveraging boosting techniques and online learning to develop a classifier that can continuously adapt and distinguish the target from its environment.
